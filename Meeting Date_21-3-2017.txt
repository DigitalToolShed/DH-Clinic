	3. Paul will discuss with Michael on figuring out how to import the .mdl database into Omeka (probably via CSV conversion and then CSV import plugin into Omeka)
	4. Discussed moving to the stage of figuring out how to structure the main Omeka site now, and possible ways to include the Make-a-thon in terms of extending the site.
	5. Discussed how the site should have a bare minimum of one exhibit with the amount of items we have digitised (and will digitise) so far.
	6. Make sure to ask Michael and Ramya to update the readme documentation on GitHub about what they've accomplished so far.
