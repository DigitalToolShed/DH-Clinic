Summary: Want to see how to can get more analysis insights from the current data we have and on the narratives

Notes:
	Try to add more information/variables/meta data tags to the current dataset.
	Can try to digitise detailed articles for each persons' narratives and then do individual analyses to see connections.
	Trying to process articles via OCR doesn't take as long; possible to do OCR for all articles.
	Discuss that for Make-a-thon, we can teach people how to use the tools that are used to make the Omeka website (e.g., Voyant Tools) during the 5th of May.
